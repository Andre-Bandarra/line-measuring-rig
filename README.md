## Description

A few people have asked me to build a laser line measurement rig for paragliders and I finally got round to doing it.
It uses a pretty inexpensive digital laser measure.
I then built two rails and two carriages for each side of the system and it worked quite well. 

## BOM

All made from 18mm baltic birch plywood.
